# Assignment-4-5 I decided to make a sky because I thought it would be easy and I wanted a blue clour scheme so boom blue sky. I made my platforms a bubble and a goldfish this is because I wanted it to be funky, and cool! I then made my character a little mysetery thing that was the reason for the fish and bubbles in the sky. LORE. Basically a wizerd decided they wanted to go across the ocean but oh no they can't walk on water like jesus so they just pulled up some fish and bubbles to walk on, mystery ooo. I used pixilart cause it was linked and I didn't wanna find a new one. I sent them to my gmail that i then signed into onto the other computers and then downloaded them as a PNG, then I went into unity clicked assets, then import new asset, and then juat dragged em in. Challenges, oh boy were there challenges. 1 - My computer doesn't have unity, 2 - All computers were being used, 3 - When I got the computer it was dead, 4 - Tried the other computer and unity refused to open, 5 - Tried the other computer after it charged and it didn't let me import any of my assets at all, 6 - I went back to the other computer and it didn't import them correctly. I faced adversity and mental challenges, but I prevailed for my mental fortitude is just so large and awesome.
